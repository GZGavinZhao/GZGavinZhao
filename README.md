我说中文。

Usually active around 3 ~ 4 a.m. UTC.

You can find me on Matrix `@gzgavinzhao:matrix.org` if you need to talk to me directly.

Note: if you see Python in the chart below, in almost all cases it's probably just Starlark (for Bazel).

A good chart for me should be a healthy balance between C++, Dart, and Haskell, with some occasional Java, D and Starlark sprinkled here and there.
